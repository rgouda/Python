This demo illustrates DevExtreme HTML5 Chart Widgetâ€™s ability to aggregate series points. Whenever you display a large data source, you can optionally aggregate points to better visualize information on-screen. The useAggregation option activates this feature. The DevExtreme HTML Range Selector is used to zoom the contents of the chart. Note that whenever the selected range is reduced, the amount of chart series aggregation is reduced as well. Review the next demo to see how aggregation can be applied to a chart displaying financial information.
