In this example, data is defined using a unique approach. Each object in the data source represents a specific point for a single series. This approach is useful when the number of series within a chart can change. To define series in this manner, use the seriesTemplate configuration object and specify the data source field that represents series names and custom settings for a given series. Settings common to chart series must be et within the commonSeriesSettings configuration object.
