To help address your specific business needs, the DevExtreme HTML5 Data Grid Widget offers different data editing options. In this demo, editing is initiated by pressing the Edit link within the command button column. Once in edit mode, cell values can be modified by using the appropriate DevExtreme cell editor (for instance, a dropdown calendar is used to edit date values). To enable editing, the editMode field of the grid’s editing configuration object is set to ‘row.’  In addition, removeEnabled and insertEnabled fields are set to <i>true</i> so end-users can add new rows and delete existing rows from the grid.
