The DevExtreme HTML5 Data Grid Widget allows you to group column headers logically to implement a banded layout. In this demo, the array of columns has a hierarchical structure, although such a layout can be built on a flat-structured array as well. Note that despite being banded, the nested columns remain interactive.
