The DevExtreme HTML5 Data Grid Widget supports virtual record scrolling, allowing end-users to navigate the contents of the grid by using its vertical scrollbar.  In this demo, the grid is connected to 100,000 records and virtual scroll mode has been enabled to simplify record navigation and eliminate the use of data pagers.
