The DevExtreme HTML5 Data Grid Widget allows you and your end-users to group data against an unlimited number of columns. In this example, data is grouped by the Country column (a group index is specified for this column within the grid’s configuration object). Your users can group data by dragging column headers to the Group Panel. You can control Group Panel visibility by using the grid’s groupPanel | visible configuration option. When dragging a column header way from the Group Panel, initial column order can change because the allowColumnReordering option is set to <i>true</i>.
