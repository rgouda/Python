The DevExtreme HTML5 Data Grid Widget allows you and your end-users to sort data against one or more columns without writing a single line of code. A column’s current sort order is indicated by a sort glyph displayed at the rightmost edge of the column header. When not sorted, this glyph is hidden. Click a column header to initiate sorting or change the column’s sort order (ascending to descending and vice versa). Press the shift key when clicking headers to sort against multiple columns simultaneously. You can also use the popup context menu (right click a column header) to initiate desired sort operations. In this example, grid columns are initially sorted by the First Name and Last Name columns in ascending order (the sortOrder option is set to ‘asc’). You can disable sorting for a specific column by setting the allowSorting option to false.
