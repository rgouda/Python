The DevExtreme HTML5 Data Grid Widget allows your end-user to shape data as needs dictate. In this example, we demonstrate the use of the built-in data grouping feature against a remote data source. Data is provided by an OData service and grid content is grouped by both Country and City columns. Note that this demo uses the gridâ€™s virtual mode and loads data on-demand as the grid content is scrolled vertically.
