The DevExtreme HTML5 Data Grid Widget ships with an API that allows you to implement your own logic when expanding/collapsing master-detail rows. In this example, only one row can be expanded at any point in time. This behavior is achieved using the <b>expandRow</b> and <b>collapseAll</b> methods called in the <b>onSelectionChanged</b> event handler.
