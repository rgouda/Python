The DevExtreme HTML5 Data Grid can hide columns according to the specified priority if screen width is not enough to display all of them. The hiding priority is specified using the "hidingPriority" field of a "columns" array item. Switch between the landscape and portrait layouts to see how the data grid looks on wide and narrow screens.
