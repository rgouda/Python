DevExtreme comes with the "dx-fieldset" CSS class that defines the appearance of an element displaying a list of field-value pairs. Each fieldset item is displayed within a separate field element, which has the “dx-field” class. The field element may include label and value elements defined by the dx-field-label and dx-field-value classes respectively.
