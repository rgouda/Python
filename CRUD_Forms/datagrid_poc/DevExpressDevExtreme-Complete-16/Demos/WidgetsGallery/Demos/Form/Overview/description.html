The DevExtreme HTML5 Form widget allows you to&nbsp;visually represents and edit data stored in&nbsp;an&nbsp;object. The widget binds each layout item to&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific field in&nbsp;an&nbsp;existing data object. To&nbsp;display a&nbsp;simple form, you can assign the required object to&nbsp;the formData option. With the form widget, you can specify the location of&nbsp;labels against corresponding editors and number of&nbsp;columns used in&nbsp;the form layout. Optionally, the widget can determine the column count based on&nbsp;current form width (adaptive rendering).
