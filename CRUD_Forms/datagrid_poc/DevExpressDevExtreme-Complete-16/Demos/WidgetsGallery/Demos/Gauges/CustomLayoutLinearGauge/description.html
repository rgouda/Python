This demo shows how to adjust the relative position of the gauge elements. The range container, value and subvalue indicators have the <b>offset</b> option that specifies a shift from the scale for this element. When this option is assigned to a positive value, the corresponding element moves down from its initial position. Otherwise, it moves up.
