The dxGallery widget supports use of custom item templates and offers multiple methods for defining template markup. In this example, the Underscore template engine is used and a custom item template is factored out into a separate element with a specified name (see the Markup demo tab). To set this template for a gallery item, the template name is assigned to the gallery's itemTemplate configuration option. To enforce use of the Underscore template engine, the DevExpress.ui.setTemplateEngine function is called with ‘underscore’ passed as a parameter.
