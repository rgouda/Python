The DevExtreme HTML5 File Uploader allows you to&nbsp;upload files to&nbsp;the server both synchronously and asynchronously. In&nbsp;this demo, the widget is&nbsp;configured for asynchronous upload. Use the <b>File types</b> option to&nbsp;select acceptable file types for the <b>Open file</b> dialog. The <b>Upload mode</b> option allows you to&nbsp;specify whether the file is&nbsp;uploaded on&nbsp;a&nbsp;button click or&nbsp;instantly after the file has been selected. In&nbsp;addition, you can specify whether the widget allows multiple file selection. 
<br /><br />
To&nbsp;select files, click the <b>Select file</b> button or&nbsp;drop the files directly over the widget. If&nbsp;upload mode is&nbsp;&laquo;useButtons&raquo;, you must click the <b>Upload button</b> or&nbsp;a&nbsp;corresponding button for each file to&nbsp;initiate upload. 
<br /><br />
IMPORTANT: This demo does not actually upload files. To&nbsp;upload files, assign the URL of&nbsp;a&nbsp;page providing server scenarios for saving uploaded files to&nbsp;the <b>uploadUrl</b> configuration option of&nbsp;the widget.
