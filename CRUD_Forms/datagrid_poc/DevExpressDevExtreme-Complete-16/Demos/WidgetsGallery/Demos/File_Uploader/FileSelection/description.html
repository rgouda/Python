The DevExtreme HTML5 File Uploader allows you to&nbsp;upload files to&nbsp;a&nbsp;server both synchronously and asynchronously. This demo illustrates use of&nbsp;the File Uploader within a&nbsp;web page. To&nbsp;select a&nbsp;file using the <b>Open file</b> dialog, click the <b>Select photo</b> button. Note that the <b>Open file</b> dialog only accepts image file types as&nbsp;the <b>accept</b> configuration option of&nbsp;the File Uploader is&nbsp;set to&nbsp;&laquo;image/*&raquo;. 
<br /><br />
IMPORTANT: This demo does not actually upload the selected file. To&nbsp;upload a&nbsp;file, submit the form. The form element should contain the <b>action</b> attribute, which holds the URL of&nbsp;the page providing server scenarios for saving uploaded files.
