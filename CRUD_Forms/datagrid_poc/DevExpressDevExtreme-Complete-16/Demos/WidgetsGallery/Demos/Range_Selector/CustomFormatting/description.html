This demo demonstrates the RangeSelector's capability to set a custom format. The slider marker format is customized via the "customizeText" callback. The scale data is also formatted since the initial precision that is set in the coming datasource is not suitable to properly display the data. So, a more appropriate precision is set for scale labels.
